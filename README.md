# Data analysis of multiomics data of breast milk samples

This Stata script is designed for the comprehensive analysis of fatty acid data merged with metadata based on sample IDs. The main objectives are to calculate and analyze metrics such as total SFA%, total MUFA%, total n3PUFA%, total n6PUFA%, and related ratios across different collection times, and to examine the correlations between these fatty acid levels.

## Key Features:

Data Integration: Merge fatty acid and metadata using 'sampleid'.

Data Preprocessing: Clean and standardize variable names for clarity.

Analytical Calculations: Compute total percentages and ratios for various fatty acids.

Visualization: Generate histograms to visualize fatty acid distributions.

Correlation Analysis: Use Spearman's correlation to explore relationships between fatty acids across timepoints V1 and V4.

Summary Statistics: Calculate and present median and interquartile ranges.

## Usage:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have Stata installed and configured to run .dta files.
Open and run the scripts in the order they appear for comprehensive data analysis.
This script is designed for robust data management and statistical analysis, facilitating deeper insights into fatty acid profiles and their implications for health.
